/**
 * The route registry (#10): what the shell needs to know about each page (title, emoji, back
 * target, width), replacing xcwds.github.io's hand-written `routeInfo` in `src/lib/nav.ts`.
 * Plugins add their pages with `app.route()` from their build entry, so the paths are known when
 * `svelte.config.js` loads and can be fed to prerender `entries`; the page bundle gets the same
 * list. Paths never include the base path (RFC 0001, decision 9).
 *
 * Also the framework-free core the page, the service worker and @xcwds/testing share, so they
 * can't drift apart: how an app is set up, which route a URL is, what guards' answers mean, and
 * which requests the worker handles.
