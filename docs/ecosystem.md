# Ecosystem

Every feature of an @xcwds app is a plugin. `pnpm xcwds add <name>` adds a first-party one to
an existing app; any other plugin installs like an npm package (see
[Writing a plugin](plugin-guide.md#8-use-it-in-an-app)).

Plugins run with the same access as the app itself, so check what one saves and which servers
it contacts before you add it. Its `network` metadata, listed on the settings page under
Privacy, says which servers and why.
